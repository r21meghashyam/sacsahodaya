      Sahodaya, an outreach programme for the empowerment of the Specially abled was started in 2000 to conscientize the staff and the students towards the needs and aspirations of the Specially Abled. The outreach programme has been constantly working with groups and institutions catering to the needs of such people. We are proud to say that the Sahodayans have imbibed the spirit of growing together and lend their mite towards empowering people with disabilities even after completion of their studies.
